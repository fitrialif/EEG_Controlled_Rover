# EEG_Controlled_Rover
A BCI implementation to control a rover with real time EEG data.

Using Emotiv Insight, we obtain raw EEG data from the subject and train the Cortex API to learn the commands needed to control the rover.

In the future, we would like to write a deep learning model to classify the raw vectorised EEG data. Possibly a CNN-RNN or an LSTM network.
